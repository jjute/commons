# Java Jute Commons Library

---

This is a simple Java library for everyday use that implements a wide range of useful utilities and essential functionalities that most beginner and intermediate Java developers should find useful. Read the features section for more information on what the library has to offer.

## Motivation

It is developed primarily for use with my personal project and my motivation to continue development comes from the continual pursuit of finding elegant and efficient conceptual and implementation Java designs which are then compiled here. However the code is completely open-source and available to everyone.

## Features

- Easy to create AOP proxies and method interceptors.
- Programmatic creation and execution of Bash scripts.
- Wrapper support for basic Git repository and command interactions. 
- Better control and easier use of Log4j loggers.
- Many utility wrappers offering more operations and finer execution.
- Useful regular expression patterns for common use.
- Lightweight Bean validation framework.
- Custom annotations with full validation support.

## Dependencies

- This project uses [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) for unit testing.
- All library logging is facilitated by [Apache Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/).
- Most utilities depend on [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/) components.
- AOP aspects are implemented with [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/).
- Backbone of Git interactions are utilizing [JGit](https://github.com/eclipse/jgit).
- Validations are performed with [Hibernate Validator Engine](http://hibernate.org/validator/). 
- IDEA integration is done with [JetBrains Java Annotations](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains/annotations).
