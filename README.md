# Java Jute Commons Library

---

This is a simple Java library for everyday use that implements a wide range of useful utilities and essential functionalities that most beginner and intermediate Java developers should find useful. Read the features section for more information on what the library has to offer.

## Motivation

It is developed primarily for use with my personal project and my motivation to continue development comes from the continual pursuit of finding elegant and efficient conceptual and implementation Java designs which are then compiled here. However the code is completely open-source and available to everyone.
